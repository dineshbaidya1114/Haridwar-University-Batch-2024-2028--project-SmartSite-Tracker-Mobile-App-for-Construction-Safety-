# 🏗️ SmartSite Tracker - Mobile App for Construction Safety

## 📱 Project Overview

**SmartSite Tracker** is a mobile application designed to improve safety and efficiency at construction sites by tracking labor movement and ensuring workers are equipped with proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). This project is developed as part of a coursework assignment under **Critical Thinking, Design Thinking, Leadership, and Framework**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Construction sites often lack proper monitoring mechanisms to track worker location and safety compliance. This app addresses:

- Real-time tracking of construction labor movement.
- Monitoring of PPE usage within designated safety zones.
- Instant alerts for non-compliance.
- Detailed analytics and reporting for site supervisors.
